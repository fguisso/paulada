# Paulada

A tool to brute force auth request in APIRest applications

Do you need an example from your raw request, just create one and put "WORDLIST" in the value that you want to change based in `wordlist.txt`.
You can use another wordlist if put here in the root of the project with this filename: `wordlist.txt`.

```bash
go run .
```

# ToDo
- Parameterize for using another options
